# Solmate

----------------------------

**No Magic/Understandable** - 
  See and read the generated client code to understand exactly what’s going on

**IDE Completion** - enjoy intelligent autocomplete, suggestions and type checking made possible because client code is *just code* not complex, polymorphic library *magic*

**Customizable** - add your own methods directly to generated classes. Any code outside `LOCK-BEGIN` and `LOCK-END` won’t be overwritten

**Extensible** - maybe your smart contract isn’t cookie-cutter, support your contract’s quirks outside of anchor norms by sub-classing `Codegen`
